## Introduction

:::info

The terminology Phase 1 is being used interchangeably to refer to services that are originally built for DuitNow Transfer i.e. Account Enquiry, Credit Transfer and National Addressing Database (NAD) related. QR, P2P, JomPAY and etc are built as overlay services on top of Phase 1. Hence these overlay services will adopt similar architecture and user will be asked to refer to Phase 1 sections throughout our documentations

:::

Instant Transfer is a Credit Transfer service in which the customer sends the payment request and confirms the recipient's name before the actual credit transfer is performed. This payment request is a two-step process where an account enquiry request is sent to the Receiving Participant to request for the recipient's name, and upon successful retrieval of the Account Name, displays it to the customer for confirmation. Once confirmation is received, the Originating Participant then debits customer account and sends the actual Credit Transfer request to the Receiving Participant for processing

DuitNow Transfer will be marketed for use by the Participants' Retail and Corporate customers and invoked from the Participants' Internet and Mobile Banking channels

## Account Enquiry

:::note

Account resolution enquiry is used to determine if particular beneficiary account is valid and ready to receive payment. There are many situations in which you may need to know if a beneficiary account provided by customer is valid before accepting payment request. Examples include:
