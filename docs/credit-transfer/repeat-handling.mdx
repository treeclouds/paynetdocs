# Repeat Handling

## How It Works

In the event the Sender fails to receive a response from RPP, the transaction status may fall into the state of unknown. In such scenario, the Sender could resend the request, but it may cause a duplicate posting as the original request could have been processed successfully in RPP

To mitigate such situation, RPP introduces a repeat request feature to support the Sender to resend the original request but indicating the request could be a retry attempt. This helps RPP to filter our any possible duplicate attempt. However, such feature should only be used during exceptional scenario and shall not be used as a default option to all requests

In the API Business Application Header, **<PssblDplct\>** shall be set to true to indicate the request is a retry (REPEAT) attempt to prevent duplicate payment. Though, not all APIs are supporting this retry feature. User shall refer to the respective API specification for more information

### How to handle REPEAT request

Whenever RPP receives a REPEAT request, it will:

- Check if both the original request and response messages have been received
- If both original request and response messages are found:
  - RPP will not send a Credit Transfer message request
  - RPP will return to the OFI with the original message response
- If only the original message request is found:
  - RPP will place the REPEAT request into a REPEAT queue
  - The REPEAT request will be picked up and send to RFI for processing
  - RPP will return to the OFI with the REPEAT message response from RFI

Whenever RFI receives a REPEAT request, it will:

- If the original transaction has been posted successfully by the RFI, RFI will respond with the original transaction response instead of rejecting the REPEAT request as duplicate
- If the original transaction has not been processed previously, RFI will process the transaction and return the appropriate response to RPP

:::info

Participant is advised to perform a Transaction Enquiry first before initiating a retry attempt. Such inquiry allows Participant to confirm on the stage of the payment and reduces the frictions in performing a transaction retry immediately
