 **7.** Open a Command Prompt in your Windows machine and navigate to the location where the public key is saved.

 **8.** The commands for connecting to different infrastructures are listed below. Run the command for the infrastructure you wish to connect to:


<div className="ul__wrapper">

  - UAT internet: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.uat.inet.paynet.my:.ssh/`
  - PRD internet: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.prod.inet.paynet.my:.ssh/`
  - UAT MPLS: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.uat.mpls.paynet.my:.ssh/`
  - PRD  MPLS: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.prod.mpls.paynet.my:.ssh/`

</div>

 **9.** You will be prompted to enter a password. Enter the password provided by PayNet SAC in email and upload of public key will start.

 **10.** Once done, you will be able to login to PayNet Reports server. You will need to ensure PayNet internet IP is whitelisted in your company firewall. Please see <a href="/documentation/fi-server" className="blue-link">Connecting to SFTP with PuTTY and SSH key.</a>
 
 
### Instructions (Linux)

 **1.** Run command `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521` and press enter until public and private keys are generated.
 
  ![Example banner](../../static/img/linux-1.png)

  <ul>
    <li> i. Use **RSA** with **4096** bit in case your infrastructure does not support ECDSA 521</li>
  </ul>

 **2.** The commands for different infrastructures are listed below. Paynet SAC will provide username and password in email for this step.

<div className="ul__wrapper">

  - UAT internet: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub username@reports.uat.inet.paynet.my`
  - PRD internet: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub username@reports.prod.inet.paynet.my`
  - UAT MPLS: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub username@reports.uat.mpls.paynet.my`
  - PRD  MPLS: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub username@reports.prod.mpls.paynet.my`

</div>

 **3.** Public key copied to SFTP server successfully.
