- Use PuTTY to initiate first SSH connectivity to Reports server infrastructure with new user account and OTP issued by PayNet SAC. For internet connectivity, please ensure PayNet IP is whitelisted in your company firewall.
- Open a Command Prompt in your Windows machine and navigate to the location where the public key is saved.
- The commands for connecting to different infrastructures are listed below. Run the command for the infrastructure you wish to connect to:
  <div className="list__wrapper list-code__wrapper">

    - UAT internet: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.uat.inet.paynet.my:.ssh/`
    - PRD internet: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.prod.inet.paynet.my:.ssh/`
    - UAT MPLS: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.uat.mpls.paynet.my:.ssh/`
    - PRD  MPLS: `scp authorized_keys <username>@reports.prod.mpls.paynet.my:.ssh/`

  </div>

- You will be prompted to enter a password. Enter the password provided by PayNet SAC in email and upload of public key will start.
