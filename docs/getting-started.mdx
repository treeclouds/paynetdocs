# Getting Started

## Introduction

The Paynet Developer Portal offers a set of Application Programming Interfaces (API) to assist 
you in incorporating the various services or products that PayNet can provide for your projects. 
This page will help you kick off your journey on this Portal, first with a guide to register as a user, 
create your very first project and finally add the available APIs to be used in your project. 
Moving forward, there are various guides and documentations that can assist you as you start to implement the APIs in your projects. There are plenty of APIs that you will find helpful for your projects, so let's get started!


## Registration

Before you get started, you are required to register for an account. You may nominate a person from your organisation, or create individual accounts to work on separate projects. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to you once your registration is successful.

**Step 1:** To register, first click on the **Register** button that can be found on the Home Page where it will redirect you to the Registration page.

Alternatively, there is a **Create Account** button on the top right of the page, which will redirect you to the same page.

**Step 2:** On the Registration page, proceed to fill in the form with the required information. Make sure the information are accurate and up to date.

## Create your First Project

Once you have succesfully registered your account, your next step is to create your first project. A project can only be bound to a single product; learn more about our available products by referring to the API reference pages.

**Step 1:** To create your first project, navigate to the **Projects** page under your profile and click the **Create project** button.

**Step 2:** Fill in the fields with your project's Name and Description and select the Product API that will be used for the project. Select the specific API that you want to include in the Project for the relevant Product. Proceed with **Confirm** when you are done.

## Start Using the Sandbox

The PayNet Sandbox is a free and fully integrated environment to support users in application development and testing purposes.

**Step 1:** To start with the Sandbox, navigate to the Project Page of your newly created project and click on the **Request for Sandbox** button as shown:

**Step 2:** A Sandbox profile will be created and you will be required to complete some assignments to configure the sandbox. Proceed by clicking the three dots `...` next to the **Registration** and click **Edit profile**.

The Configuration column will be completed by the administration side. Once the admin has configured your Sandbox for the particular API, the Status will be changed to Completed:

**Step 3:** Fill in the form with the relevant information for the API used in the project to be submitted for review.

:::note

The corresponding form for configuring the Sandbox profile will depend on the selected API.

:::

**Step 4:** Once you have completed the form, click on **Save** at the bottom of the page. Your request will be reviewed. After an admin has reviewed your request, the status of the Registration will be updated to **Completed**. If your request is rejected, you will need to modify some of the fields in the form and submit it for approval again. If your request is accepted, you can proceed to making API requests through the Sandbox.

## Project Testing and Production Validation

Each project will require test cases to be completed and test results to be submitted before going live. An admin will review the test results, and either reject or accept the test results. Test scenarios are varied across products; to find out all the test scenarios that you will need to complete, head over to PayNet Docs and refer to the Test Data page for each respective product.

## Going Live

Once you are ready to promote your project from the Development to Production environment, you may initiate the process to go live and commercialize your project. To submit your project to PayNet for review and approval, and to request product pricing and a contract, simply go to the dashboard and select Request To Production. The dashboard walks you through the detailed steps and processes to complete the application for the credentials for your project. Based on your profile and your projectâ€™s use case, you will be asked to provide specific details that will help PayNet evaluate your request and provide you with commercial terms and pricing for the PayNet capabilities that you identified for your project.

Once your PayNet Developer Project is fully promoted to the Production environment and you want to use additional PayNet APIs, you will need to create a separate project and the flow starts again.
