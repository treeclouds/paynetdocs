# Sandbox Overview

The PayNet Sandbox is a free and fully integrated environment to support users in application development and testing. It provides a variety of test credentials and data for users to test against.

## Using Sandbox

You can send a request to the Sandbox by sending the HTTPS requests to the respective endpoints. The endpoints are shown in the respective product API reference.

Thereâ€™s several sandbox that we provide depending on user readiness in application development.

| Default       |  Get started with test credential and life-like data. Test immediately using these without any prior configuration and approval. |
| Development   |  Build out your app with dedicated credential. Create a new project under your profile. The new credential will be provided once the request is reviewed and approved by our Administrator. |
| Production    |  Launch your app with live credentials. You must complete all the test scenarios listed development before you could seek approval to go live with your application. |
